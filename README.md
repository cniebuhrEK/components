## How to develop on local project:
1. Clone the components git repository
2. Install packages by running `yarn`
3. Run `yarn start` to build the library with tracking changes
4. Go to your **local project**, and edit your package.json dependencies:
```
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "link:../components/node_modules/@testing-library/jest-dom",
    "@testing-library/react": "link:../components/node_modules/@testing-library/react",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "link:../components/node_modules/@testing-library/user-event",
    "@types/jest": "link:../components/node_modules/@types/jest",
    "@types/node": "link:../components/node_modules/@types/node",
    "@types/react": "link:../components/node_modules/@types/react",
    "@types/react-dom": "link:../components/node_modules/@types/react-dom",
    "examkrackers-components": "link:../components",
    "styled-components": "link:../components/node_modules/styled-components",
    "react": "link:../components/node_modules/react",
    "react-dom": "link:../components/node_modules/react-dom"
```
5. In your **local project** remove yarn.lock file and run yarn install (or run `yarn reset` if it is defined in package.json)
6. In your **local project** run `yarn start`

### Now every change in 'components' will be visible in your local project :)

> **âš  WARNING:** Remember to remove the changes from package.json and reset yarn.lock of the **local project** when you are finished.


## Storybook Development
1. Clone the components git repository
2. Install packages by running `yarn`
3. Run `yarn storybook:start` to build the storybook

## Install in your project

1. To install in the project add:

```
{
    dependencies: {
        ...
        "examkrackers-components": "https://git.desmart.com/examkrackers/components.git"
    }
}
```
in your project dependencies and run `yarn` or remove yarn.lock and then run `yarn`

2. Import the ThemeProvider and wrap your application with it:

```
...
import { ThemeProvider } from 'examkrackers-components';
...

const Root = (props) => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App {...context} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}

```

and you can use the components within the project, eg.

```
...
import { Button } from 'examkrackers-components';

const SubmitButton = (props) => {
  return (
    <Button>
      Submit
    </Button>
  )
}

```

## Adding assets

All assets are kept in the `src/assets` directory. To add a new asset you need to remember about few things:
1. After adding a new asset on development mode, you need to re-run the `yarn start` command, so the script can copy-paste the latest version of the directory
2. While using assets use relative paths as you are in the build directory, eg:
  By adding a new asset `src/assets/images/example.png`, the source would be: `/assets/images/example.png`

## Deploy a new version

If you want to update the components directory remember about few things:
1. Update yarn.lock of each project that is using this directory
2. Bump package.json version of components directory and push a new tag with the new version
